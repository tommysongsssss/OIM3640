    "\n",
    "John is drunk today. Starting from a given starting point, he walks on a grid of streets. At each intersection, he **randomly** picks one of four directions and stumbles to the next intersection. You might think that, on average, John does not move very far because the random choices cancel each other out, but that is actually not the case.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Implement the function `drunkard_walk(x, y, n)` below, which takes the starting coordinates `(x, y)` and the number of steps `n`, and returns the final coordinates and the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) (i.e., the sum of horizontal and vertical distances).\n",
    "- Explain your logic clearly in comments, especially:\n",
    "  - How does your function handle random movement?\n",
    "  - Are there alternative ways to implement this?"

    "One of the edge cases was that the extra payment was way too large where it would pay off my loan too early, before 12 months. I then fixed this by only having 200 dollars for extra payment and it worked pretty well. Situations where there is no interest rate or where the starting month was bigger than the ending month also did not work out. For the random walk function, it did not work when I entered 0 for steps and trails and it also did not work when I spammed large numbers such as 100000000000000000000000000 as my computer will not be able to process it. I made sure the distance was always positive.\n",

    "Project idea: Ever since fourth grade, I was a big fan of Clash of Clans and I continue to play the same game until this day. I really enjoyd the game because the feeling of building a village that grows over time through upgrades and strategy feels very rewarding. Therefore, my dream Python project would be creating a game with a similar mindaet but singular player where the playe can design and expand their own village over time. The game will require a lot of dedication as upgrades will take an extensive amount of time where the player will have to patiently wait and eventually getting the satisfaction of the rewarding upgrade. In the world of so many multiplayer games that required very fast instincts and a lot of communication and competition with other players, I want my game to be different and not be fast paced. I wish players will be able to calm down playing my game and use their creativity and imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Users: I want the game to be designed for people that are not gifted with fast instincts for the modern day games or people who simply feel too stressed when playing over competitive games. I want my game to be for casual gamers who enjoy creativity. At the same time, this game will not require a lot of actual playing time because I do not like the idea of people being trapped in a game after being addicted. This is also why I want the upgrade times to be long where the players will have to take breaks from the game and enjoy life outside of the digital world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Core features: One of the core features that I want to implement is village building where players will have to start with a very small area and eventually expand, building their farms, defneses, and houses. I would want to also implement a lot of customizable objects where players could design their village as they wish, where players would not have identical villages but unique ones. Another feature is the upgrade will take a lot of time rather than it being instant, therefore it required dedication over time and patience for buildings to improve gradually, this will also generate more pleasure and satisfaction when they are actually able to build a decent village. Another feature is that unlike other games who highly encourages players to pay to win, I want my game to be entirely disconnected with actual money where there will be no shortcuts to an actual decently progressed village.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters: This game will be meaningful for me because I want this game to be a game that is very different from games in the modern world. Games in the modern way takes away the joy and calmness that games are supposed to bring. Games today requires a person to be highly competitive with high reflexs where people are extremely tensed up and stressed. Games today also encourages people to charge money within the game to bring a significant advanatge and a lot of teenagers are falling for this trap and using way too much money. I believe games should be fair and square and should not have shortcuts. This game I wish to make will make every player equal and it will be a stress free game with no competition with others and will actually calm people down. At the same time as a beginner in Python, I believe this will be a great chance for me to actually fall in love with coding as I will not only code for homework that is required but to code something that I actually want to make. \n",
    "\n",
    "MVP: The simplest first version would be a text-based game where players will type texts and comments to build their village and upgrade buildings and the village will be displayed with a 2d one color image or the levels will be displayed in text. However, it will be able to progress slowly by adding more detail to graphics and colors. "
